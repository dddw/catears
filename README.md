# catears
makes a cat sound everytime you type 'cat' in the terminal
Inspired by some things Jaron Larnier mentioned in 'you are not a gadget'

# Mac OSX

* you'll need [Textexpander from Smile](https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander)
* move the file 'cat.wav' to your ~/Library/Sounds folder
* doubleclick 'catears.textexpander' (after installing Textexpander)
* change category settings as displayed in 'example-settings.png' if needed

# Linux 

* a Linux version will follow shortly, dependent on autokey
